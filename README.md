# Detecting COVID-19 with Chest X Ray using PyTorch
Early and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 is crucial to contain its spread and initiate timely treatment. The standard diagnostic methods such as nasal and throat swabs (RT-PCR tests) often suffer from low sensitivity and delayed results, leading to false negatives and uncontrolled transmission. This project aim to develop an intelligent framework using deep learning, specifically the ResNet-18 convolutional neural network, to:

Automatically classify **chest X-ray images** into three categories:
  -  **COVID-19**
  -  **Pneumonia (non-COVID)**
  -  **Normal (Healthy)**
